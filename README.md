This project was built alongside a <a href="https://yusuf-4hmed.github.io/Simple-Weather-App/">t utorial</a> just as a way for me to improve my JavaScript skills, but we all know that blindly following tutorials isn't the most effective way to learn ðŸ™‚

Which is why I will be updating this project in the future independenty:
- [ ] Update the style of the site to make it more modern
- [ ] Improve the user experience with little details e.g keypress event
- [ ] Adding times for when the weather changes


### Built With
